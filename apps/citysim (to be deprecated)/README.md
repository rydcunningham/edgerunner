# CitySim

A simulation framework for urban mobility networks, focusing on ridesharing and food delivery systems. CitySim leverages OpenStreetMap data and various spatial analysis tools to model and visualize urban transportation dynamics.

## Features

- City-scale network simulation using SimPy
- Integration with OpenStreetMap for real-world road networks
- Spatial analysis using H3 hexagonal hierarchical grid system
- Advanced visualization with kepler.gl and hubble.gl
- Network analysis with NetworkX
- Support for various vehicle types and charging infrastructure

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
